# DesignPatternsProject
## This project is written with C#.
In this project I used Composite, Observer and MVC Design Patterns. 
This project is a simple online shopping program.
If you want, you can create products, packages which contain these products or boxes which contain these packages and products.
You can see your total basket price, you can control products' stock situation.
If there is not enough product, you will see an allert on the view.
If your basket price is also under the min price, then there is an another warning about how much money do you have to be up to the min price. 
You can also see how many products does each package contains or how many item does each box contains.
